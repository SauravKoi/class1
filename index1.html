   <h1>Hello Mr</h1>
   <img src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/National_City_Bank_Building_55_Wall_Street.jpg/182px-National_City_Bank_Building_55_Wall_Street.jpg">
   <p>is a building and U.S. National Historic Landmark on Wall Street between William Street and Hanover Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. The building's facade contains two stacked colonnades, while its interior includes a cruciform banking hall. The building was completed by 1842 as the four-story Merchants' Exchange, designed by Isaiah Rogers in the Greek Revival style. The United States Custom House used the building from 1862 to 1907, before a new Custom House building was built on Bowling Green. Between 1907 and 1910, McKim, Mead & White removed the original fourth story and added five floors. It was the headquarters of Citibank's predecessor National City Bank from 1908 to 1961. The upper stories were converted to condominiums in 2006, and the banking room became a ballroom. The facade and part of the interior are New York City designated landmarks, and the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
